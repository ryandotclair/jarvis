## Steps to Run Locally

Using Docker:

```
docker build -t llm-chat-python .

docker run -it -v .:/app -p 8080:8080 llm-chat-python
```
In docker terminal:
```
# run all your export commands for env vars mentioned above
# And then run python command

python /app/app.py
```
Outside of docker terminal, in another terminal window:
```
# Install ngrok. This tool gives you a temporarily "published" URL
pip install pyngrok

# Run the ngrok tool
ngrok http 8080

# Grab the public URL that redirects to your localhost:8080
# Put this URL in your Twillio's phone number's messaging webhook
```
